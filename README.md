# Maze
XR Class Maze Project

Hello classmates, 
Here is my maze, it def needs some fine tuning and love in the next week. 

A few issues it currently has:
the teleporting ball sometimes doesn't show or if it does, it is very glitchy 
When adding the grab area for direct grab on key, it kept getting more messed up, so I got rid of it for now
I wasn't able to grab direct with my right hand so I was left hand ray grabbing the key and "passing" to my right hand

The height seems off to me? suggestions? Is it the height of my camera offset you think? or my walls? hmm
