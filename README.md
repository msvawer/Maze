# Maze
XR Class Maze Project

Hello classmates, 
Here is my maze, it def needs some fine tuning and love in the next week. 

I attached a walk through video.  If you are able to play the unityPackage that is great but I wasn't able to when I opened in a different project than the one I made it in because I got InputManager Errors (I made it using default xr input action and did some changes like in the tutorials)

A few issues it currently has:

the teleporting ball sometimes doesn't show or if it does, it is very glitchy 

When adding the grab area for direct grab on key, it kept getting more messed up, so I got rid of it for now
I wasn't able to grab direct the key with my right hand so I was left hand ray grabbing the key and "passing" to my right hand

All screenshots, walkthrough video and unity package are in github files but also here is link to google folder
